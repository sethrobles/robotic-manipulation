These are all XML formats to describe robots or objects for robot simulators or visualization. See [Doxygen](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__multibody__parsing.html) for documentation of the current support for each of these formats.\n\nIn a high-level sense, you express different components of your robot using `<link>` tags and connect them via `<joint>` tags. Each `<link>` has three major subtags, `<visual>`, `<collision>`, and `<inertial>`, for its visualization, planning/collision checking, and dynamics aspects. For `<visual>` and `<collision>`, you can either use primitives (box, sphere, cylinder, etc.) or meshes (.gltf or .obj) to represent the underlying geometry.\n\nDocumentation for the specific tags supported by Drake for each of these formats can be found [here](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__multibody__parsing.html). Here are some useful resources specifically for [URDF](http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/Tutorials/Building%20a%20Visual%20Robot%20Model%20with%20URDF%20from%20Scratch) and [SDFormat](https://classic.gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=build_model) creation.\n\n### URDF vs. SDFormat\n\nWhile URDF is the standardized format in ROS, it's lacking many features to describe a more complex scene. For example, URDF can only specify the kinematic and dynamic properties of a single robot in isolation. It can't specify joint loops and friction properties. Additionally, it can't specify things that are not robots, such as lights, heightmaps, etc.\n\nSDFormat was created to solve the shortcomings of URDF. SDFormat is a complete description for everything from the world level down to the robot level. This scalability makes it more suitable for sophisticated simulations.\n\nThis tutorial will primarily focus on leveraging SDFormat, but the differences in using URDF should be minimal with some syntax changes.\n\n### Mesh file formats\n\nYou can use a mesh file for any of your robot `<link>` entries. The file formats that Drake supports (and the nature of that support) is [documented here](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__geometry__file__formats.html). Generally, glTF (`.gltf`) is the preferred format in Drake for visualization. OBJ (`.obj`) is another well-supported alternative. If you have other file formats, [Meshlab](https://www.meshlab.net/), an open-source software, is a handy tool to convert common formats to a `.obj`.","block_group":"14ee4cba9bad4898bf841daaab1296ac"},{"cellId":"9196717dca02440d8465316f588bc60d","cell_type":"code","metadata":{"source_hash":"9af52506","execution_start":1758051535690,"execution_millis":770,"execution_context_id":"e8438e49-f999-47ac-b728-600ef88d175f","cell_id":"9196717dca02440d8465316f588bc60d","deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"# Import some basic libraries and functions for this tutorial.\nimport numpy as np\nimport os\n\nfrom pydrake.common import temp_directory\nfrom pydrake.geometry import SceneGraphConfig, StartMeshcat\nfrom pydrake.math import RigidTransform, RollPitchYaw\nfrom pydrake.multibody.parsing import Parser\nfrom pydrake.multibody.plant import AddMultibodyPlantSceneGraph\nfrom pydrake.systems.analysis import Simulator\nfrom pydrake.systems.framework import DiagramBuilder\nfrom pydrake.visualization import AddDefaultVisualization, ModelVisualizer","block_group":"0d573f12f0c0433eac3c1f97e7c53aef","execution_count":1,"outputs":[],"outputs_reference":null,"content_dependencies":null},{"cellId":"dd8b5c51c85a4471a6362191df811b9a","cell_type":"code","metadata":{"source_hash":"450eddfc","execution_start":1758051536515,"execution_millis":28,"execution_context_id":"e8438e49-f999-47ac-b728-600ef88d175f","cell_id":"dd8b5c51c85a4471a6362191df811b9a","deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"# Start the visualizer.

Those are the collision geometries defined in `iiwa7_with_box_collision.sdf` that are usually consumed by a motion planning or collision checking module when running the simulation.\n\nEven though we can use the same mesh to represent both the visual and collision geometry, approximating a complex mesh, like the KUKA arm, by primitive shapes can reduce the computation enormously. It's easier to check whether two cylinders collide than two irregular cylinder-like meshes. For that reason, we tend to load mesh files as the visual geometry but utilize various primitives as the collision geometry.\n\n### Define collision geometry for your model\n\nAs collision geometry is merely an approximation for the actual shape of your model, we want the approximation to be reasonably close to reality. A rule of thumb is to completely envelop the actual shape but not inflate it too much. For example, rather than trying to cover an L-shape model with one giant box, using two boxes or cylinders can actually better represent the shape.\n\nIt's a balancing act between the fidelity of the approximation and the computation cycles saved. When in doubt, start with a rough approximation around the actual shape and see if any undesired behavior is introduced, e.g., the robot thinks it's in a collision when it's apparently not. Identify the questionable part of the collision geometry and replace it with a more accurate approximation, and then iterate.\n\n### Creating an SDFormat wrapper around a mesh file\n\nYou might have a mesh file of an object to manipulate and want to add it to a simulation. The easiest option is to pass the OBJ file to `Parser.AddModels` directly. Parsing it directly will use default assumptions for scale, mass, etc.\n\nIn case those defaults are insufficient, you should create an SDFormat wrapper file to specify the additional properties (mass, inertia, scale, compliance, etc.) and load that file instead. You can use the [pydrake.multibody.mesh_to_model](https://drake.mit.edu/pydrake/pydrake.multibody.mesh_to_model.html) command-line tool to generate a baseline SDFormat file that you can then further customize.\n\nAnother interesting up-and-coming option is [obj2mjcf](https://github.com/kevinzakka/obj2mjcf/), which also does mesh reprocessing. Drake can load MuJoCo XML files, but does not yet quite support enough of the MuJoCo file format to inter-operate well with obj2mjcf. You might be able to get it working with some fiddling.\n\n### Use a mesh as collision geometry\n\nIn some cases you need to have a detailed collision geometry for your simulation, e.g., in the case of dexterous manipulation for objects with an irregular shape, it might be justifiable to use a mesh as the collision geometry directly.\n\nWhen an OBJ mesh is served as the collision geometry for a basic contact model, i.e., the point contact model, Drake will internally compute the convex hull of the mesh and use that instead. If you need a non-convex collision geometry, it's suggested to decompose your mesh to various convex shapes via a convex decomposition tool. There are many similar tools available that are mostly thin wrappers on [V-HACD](https://github.com/kmammou/v-hacd/). Among all, [convex_decomp_to_sdf](https://github.com/gizatt/convex_decomp_to_sdf) is a wrapper that we often use for Drake.\n\nHowever, for a more complex contact model that Drake provides, such as the hydroelastic contact model, Drake can directly utilize the actual mesh for its contact force computation. Refer to [Hydroelastic user guide](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__hydroelastic__user__guide.html) for more information.","block_group":"e1a34f461abe4691b83dac745d95b509"},{"cellId":"28de8d8192f44c74b49d71ed890438aa","cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"28de8d8192f44c74b49d71ed890438aa","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"### Drake extensions to SDFormat/URDF\n\nHopefully, you now have a clear picture of how to create, load, and visualize basic SDFormat and URDF models in Drake via MeshCat.\n\nIn Drake, we extend URDF and SDFormat to allow access to Drake-specific features by adding Drake's custom tags. In the following example, `drake:compliant_hydroelastic` custom tag is added under the `collision` tag to declare a different contact model for a particular geometry. On the other hand, there are also features in both formats that Drake's parser doesn't support.

A [`Diagram`](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/classdrake_1_1systems_1_1_diagram.html) is used to represent a meta-system that may have several interconnected Systems that function collectively.\n\nEach System and Diagram has its own [`Context`](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/classdrake_1_1systems_1_1_context.html) to represent its state and will be updated as the simulation progresses.\n\nThe Context and the Diagram are the only two pieces of information a simulator needs to run.

One thing to note in this example is we fix (or \"weld\") the table with respect to the world while treating the cracker box and the cylinder as free bodies. Once the MultibodyPlant is all set up properly, the function returns a diagram that a Drake Simulator consumes (a default context is used in this case).","block_group":"e0f33b289190438b87e46820a5efa453"},{"cellId":"c0ebafe9590f4a24b07bed7e4ef7fc67","cell_type":"code","metadata":{"source_hash":"8a8dfc0","execution_start":1758051595675,"execution_millis":0,"execution_context_id":"e8438e49-f999-47ac-b728-600ef88d175f","cell_id":"c0ebafe9590f4a24b07bed7e4ef7fc67","deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"def create_scene(sim_time_step):\n    # Clean up the Meshcat instance.\n    meshcat.Delete()\n    meshcat.DeleteAddedControls()\n\n    builder = DiagramBuilder()\n    plant, scene_graph = AddMultibodyPlantSceneGraph(\n        builder, time_step=sim_time_step)\n    parser = Parser(builder)\n\n    # Loading models.\n    # Load the table top and the cylinder we created.\n    parser.AddModelsFromString(cylinder_sdf, \"sdf\")\n    parser.AddModels(table_top_sdf_file)\n    # Load a cracker box from Drake. \n    parser.AddModels(\n        url=\"package://drake_models/ycb/003_cracker_box.sdf\")\n    # Load an OBJ file from Drake, with no SDFormat wrapper file.

The time step of the simulation may become extremely small (e.g., < 0.001s) due to the poorly specified system. Alternatively, you may receive an error message about `Delta > 0` or a warning that the inertial matrix is not physically valid.\n\nDouble-check the inertial properties, especially if the dynamic behavior is the focus of the simulation. To visually assess the inertial properties, use the inertia visualization layer in `ModelVisualizer`. In the controls, under `Scene >> drake`, check the `inertia` checkbox.\n\nTo automatically calculate inertias for a URDF or SDFormat model, try the [fix_inertia](https://drake.mit.edu/pydrake/pydrake.multibody.fix_inertia.html) tool.\n\n### Debugging the mass property\nYou don't need to specify the mass of an object if it's welded to the world. However, an error will be triggered if you have a movable object with zero mass as the simulation is not yet fully specified.\n\nHint: Does the mass/inertia of the movable objects seem reasonable? Try modifying them and rerun the simulation to observe changes.","block_group":"ab027b44059042729a8c45078da10a29"},{"cellId":"99793b6847454e6c8f1098784bc0a330","cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"99793b6847454e6c8f1098784bc0a330","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"## Next steps\n\nThis tutorial helps you set up the physics (MultibodyPlant) and geometry engines (SceneGraph) and visualize the simulation in MechCat.
