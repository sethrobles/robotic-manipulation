It also shows you how to report contact results numerically and visualize them in MeshCat. For context, we use a simple example of a compliant block dropped onto a rigid horizontal rectangular plate. Contact forces are calculated and visualized.\n\nFor example, the below-left picture shows one frame of the block's contact, with the complex set of contact forces visualized as a contact wrench (force/torque), with the force as a red arrow and the torque as a blue arrow. The below-right picture zooms into the hydroelastic contact surface showing pressure distribution, with black for zero pressure (right edge) and white for highest pressure (left-edge). Because the block is rocking back and forth on the plate, the contact patch is located at one edge of the bottom face of the block instead of the entire rectangular face.\n\n![HydroelasticTutorialImage600x388.jpg](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/HydroelasticTutorialImage600x388.jpg)\n\nDrake's *Hydroelastic Contact Model* evolved at Toyota Research Institute in conjunction with the work by Ryan Elandt who invented the [*Pressure Field Contact (PFC)*](https://ecommons.cornell.edu/handle/1813/112919) model.  Ryan's PhD thesis describes the usefulness of the PFC model:\n\n> \"*...This model is useful in situations where deformation in the contact region is qualitatively important, but need not be accurate. PFC is a model of, and not a convergent approximation of, continuum mechanics. In PFC, each of the two contacting objects is assigned an immutable internal virtual pressure field. ... the PFC contact surface is defined as the set of points where the two pressure fields are equal. ...*\"\n\nFor an excellent overview of hydroelastic contact, read these two articles (less than 10 minutes each):\n\n- [Rethinking Contact Simulation for Robot Manipulation](https://medium.com/toyotaresearch/rethinking-contact-simulation-for-robot-manipulation-434a56b5ec88)\n- [Drake: Model-based design in the age of robotics and machine learning.](https://medium.com/toyotaresearch/drake-model-based-design-in-the-age-of-robotics-and-machine-learning-59938c985515)\n\nGenerally, hydroelastic contact is faster than Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and more continous and stable than point contact models, particularly in realistic situations involving friction, rolling, energy dissipation, and non-convex geometries. Hydroelastic contact does not include deformation (as in FEA) and is slower than the point contact models used in some simulators (including an optional one in Drake).\n\nWhen two rigid bodies are interacting due to hydroelastic contact, neither has actual mechanical deformation, i.e., the bodys' mass, center of mass, and inertia properties are unaffected by hydroelastic contact. However, their force interaction is calculated as if there were deformation.","block_group":"d022e5bff8a147e8a52206eff6b85ec9"},{"cellId":"ed4b049a88e14db3b77516ebc5b5032b","cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"ed4b049a88e14db3b77516ebc5b5032b","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"### Compliant-hydroelastic geometries and rigid-hydroelastic geometries\n\nThere are two types of hydroelastic geometries. The first, called \"compliant-hydroelastic\", is a solid which contains a tetrahedral mesh that describes an internal pressure field. (Note: the pressure on the solid's surface is zero, and for fast computation, the simulator pre-calculates the internal pressure field -- before a contact is possible). The second, called \"rigid-hydroelastic\", only has a triangle surface mesh (hence the geometry may be a solid or a surface) and is regarded as infinitely stiff.\n\n![HydroelasticTutorialCompliantRigidOutsideInside800x669.jpg](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/HydroelasticTutorialCompliantRigidOutsideInside800x669.jpg)","block_group":"4cd155af48d0492c999e4a2a244da438"},{"cellId":"88bc4ff9a8284468b0121fa6f84aecbd","cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"88bc4ff9a8284468b0121fa6f84aecbd","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"### Contact surface\n\nThe figure below shows contact between a compliant-hydroelastic cylinder and a compliant-hydroelastic sphere. The contact surface is internal to both solids and is defined as the surface where the two pressure fields are equal. The shading on the contact surface shows pressure distribution varying from black (zero pressure) to red (high pressure). Mathematically, the contact surface is a blending surface between the intersecting portions of the cylinder's surface and the sphere's surface. Conceptually, for two similarly-sized spheres, the contact surface is closer to the surface of the sphere that has the larger hydroelastic modulus. See [this section](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__compliant__contact.html#hydro_contact) in Drake's discussion of compliant contact.\n\n![HydroelasticTutorialContactSurfaceCompliantCompliant.png](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/HydroelasticTutorialContactSurfaceCompliantCompliant.png)\n\nSince a rigid-hydroelastic geometry is regarded as infinitely stiff, the contact surface between a compliant-hydroelastic geometry and a rigid-hydroelastic geometry is on the surface of the rigid-hydroelastic geometry. As pictured below, two hydroelastic-compliant ellipsoidal bubble fingers are in contact with a rigid-hydroelastic cylindrical spatula handle. Hence, the contact surfaces are on the surface of the spatula handle.\n\n\n![HydroelasticTutorialContactSurfaceRigidCompliantBubble.png](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/HydroelasticTutorialContactSurfaceRigidCompliantBubble.png)","block_group":"9f77a41cbe2f466d81001ff21a748f19"},{"cellId":"1d2f4507013e4c2c8817ae6b5246e187","cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"1d2f4507013e4c2c8817ae6b5246e187","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"### Contact mode between compliant-hydroelastic geometries and rigid-hydroelastic geometries\n\nIn general, consider using compliant-hydroelastic geometries because the object's stiffness can be specified through its hydroelastic modulus to be as compliant as rubber or as stiff as steel. Compliant-hydroelastic geometries need tetrahedral meshes. Drake can automatically generate tetrahedral meshes of compliant-hydroelastic geometries for built-in shapes such as spheres, ellipsoids, cylinders, capsules, boxes, and for solids with a convex surface mesh. For non-convex objects, each mesh must be provided as a VTK file (not a .obj file) containing a tetrahedral mesh to use them as compliant-hydroelastic geometries.\n\nCompliant-hydroelastic objects interact well with either compliant-hydroelastic objects or with rigid-hydroelastic objects.\n\nAlternatively, an important use for rigid-hydroelastic geometry is for an object with a non-convex surface mesh (e.g., .obj file) whose associated tetrahedral volume mesh is not readily available. Currently, a rigid-hydroelastic geometry can only interact with compliant-hydroelastic objects. If it interacts with another rigid-hydroelastic object, the simulator reverts to point contact. The table below elaborates these and other cases.\n\n\n|                                     | rigid-hydroelastic geometry   | compliant-hydroelastic geometry |\n|:------------------------------------|:------------------------------|:--------------------------------|\n| **rigid-hydroelastic geometry**     | point contact                 | hydroelastic contact            |\n| **compliant-hydroelastic geometry** | hydroelastic contact          | hydroelastic contact            |\n| **non-hydroelastic geometry**       | point contact                 | point contact                   |\n\n","block_group":"a1176d34f95145fc8c57ea39d997d820"},{"cellId":"7049416949944ea99b0e907fd6e2af43","cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"7049416949944ea99b0e907fd6e2af43","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"## Outline\n\nThis tutorial shows you how to:\n\n1.

Then, we connect the contact results output port of MultibodyPlant to the input port of our `ContactReporter`. \n\nThe simulation in our example has only one contact patch between two geometries, but the code below can report all contact patches from all pairs of geometries from hydroelastics. However, it does not report `point_pair_contact_info()` in ContactResults.\n\nSee documentation of [ContactResults,](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/classdrake_1_1multibody_1_1_contact_results.html) [HydroelasticContactInfo,](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/classdrake_1_1multibody_1_1_hydroelastic_contact_info.html) and [ContactSurface](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/classdrake_1_1geometry_1_1_contact_surface.html) for more details.\n\nIn `__init__()` of `ContactReporter`, we declare forced publish event, so it will report contacts only when users call `ForcedPublish()` (see `run_simulation_with_contact_report()` in the next section). You can also declare periodic publish events to report contact at the frequency that you specify. See [Declare periodic events](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/classdrake_1_1systems_1_1_leaf_system.html#declare_periodic_events) in documentation of [LeafSystem.](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/classdrake_1_1systems_1_1_leaf_system.html)","block_group":"58da2f94af9d4f75971cda284726bd81"},{"cellId":"056a55f7be7d499fbb2e0c72694d9cd7","cell_type":"code","metadata":{"source_hash":"50af1bd","execution_start":1758052316645,"execution_millis":0,"execution_context_id":"cb9c2d6b-fa6d-4056-918a-9226c60a9b50","cell_id":"056a55f7be7d499fbb2e0c72694d9cd7","deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"from pydrake.common.value import Value\nfrom pydrake.multibody.plant import ContactResults\nfrom pydrake.systems.framework import LeafSystem\n\nclass ContactReporter(LeafSystem):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()  # Don't forget to initialize the base class.\n        self.DeclareAbstractInputPort(\n            name=\"contact_results\",\n            model_value=Value(\n                # Input port will take ContactResults from MultibodyPlant\n                ContactResults()))\n        # Calling `ForcedPublish()` will trigger the callback.\n        self.DeclareForcedPublishEvent(self.Publish)\n        \n    def Publish(self, context):\n        print()\n        print(f\"ContactReporter::Publish() called at time={context.get_time()}\")\n        contact_results = self.get_input_port().Eval(context)\n        \n        num_hydroelastic_contacts = contact_results.num_hydroelastic_contacts()\n        print(f\"num_hydroelastic_contacts() = {num_hydroelastic_contacts}\")\n        \n        for c in range(num_hydroelastic_contacts):\n            print()\n            print(f\"hydroelastic_contact_info({c}): {c}-th hydroelastic contact patch\")\n            hydroelastic_contact_info = contact_results.hydroelastic_contact_info(c)\n            \n            spatial_force = hydroelastic_contact_info.F_Ac_W()\n            print(\"F_Ac_W(): spatial force (on body A, at centroid of contact surface, in World frame) = \")\n            print(f\"{spatial_force}\")\n                        \n            print(\"contact_surface()\")\n            contact_surface = hydroelastic_contact_info.contact_surface()\n            num_faces = contact_surface.num_faces()\n            total_area = contact_surface.total_area()\n            centroid = contact_surface.centroid()\n            print(f\"total_area(): area of contact surface in m^2 = {total_area}\")\n            print(f\"num_faces(): number of polygons or triangles = {num_faces}\")\n            print(f\"centroid(): centroid (in World frame) = {centroid}\")        \n        \n        print()\n\ndef add_contact_report(builder, plant):   \n    contact_reporter = builder.AddSystem(ContactReporter())    \n    builder.Connect(plant.get_contact_results_output_port(),\n                    contact_reporter.get_input_port(0))\n        \n    return builder, plant","block_group":"b560079eba7b4bfebf8f334f6b1674df","execution_count":11,"outputs":[],"outputs_reference":null,"content_dependencies":null},{"cellId":"b5f7039752ab42588fa64a81ac856bdc","cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"b5f7039752ab42588fa64a81ac856bdc","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"### Run simulation and report contact results\n\nAs shown below, the function `run_simulation_with_contact_report()` calls `ForcedPublish()` after the simulation has finished.\n\nThe end of the code block calls `run_simulation_with_contact_report()` with `sim_time=0`.

Most materials has Young's modulus in the range of 1e7 Pa (rubber) to 1e12 Pa (carbon nanotube), so their hydroelastic modulus should be in the range of 1e5 Pa (rubber) to 1e10 Pa (carbon nanotube).\n\nRemove `#` in the code below and run it.\n\nPlayback slowly with timeScale 0.1 in MeshCat, and you should see a very short red arrow of contact force around 0.41 seconds.","block_group":"de534e9e94e842cda94313dd569bc8ae"},{"cellId":"9eeb113c6b824c118417e8f6f2217c22","cell_type":"code","metadata":{"source_hash":"cff4853a","execution_start":1758052330385,"execution_millis":0,"execution_context_id":"cb9c2d6b-fa6d-4056-918a-9226c60a9b50","cell_id":"9eeb113c6b824c118417e8f6f2217c22","deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"# new_hydroelastic_modulus = '1e1'\n# compliant_box_sdf = compliant_box(hydroelastic_modulus = new_hydroelastic_modulus)\n# \n# run_simulation_with_contact_report_and_viz(sim_time=2)\n# meshcat.Delete(\"/drake/contact_forces/hydroelastic/compliant_box+rigid_box_link/contact_surface\")\n# meshcat.PublishRecording()","block_group":"7ff4cf4d2da14a85ae088a7b8ac93966","execution_count":20,"outputs":[],"outputs_reference":null,"content_dependencies":null},{"cellId":"41a115f364cc4538ac9eb2b5603f31c5","cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"41a115f364cc4538ac9eb2b5603f31c5","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"### Effects of high hydroelastic modulus\n\nSimilarly, the code below sets `new_hydroelastic_modulus` to an unphysically high value of 1e15 Pascals.
