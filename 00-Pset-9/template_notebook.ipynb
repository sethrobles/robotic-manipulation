    "  1. Add the dependency to the list of dependencies in `reqirements.txt` on the left.  \n",
    "      - **Note**: Make sure to NOT remove the text that is already in the file. You should add your dependencies on new lines AFTER `manipulation=year.month.day`. For our example, the file contents will look like:\n",

    "          gcsopt\n",
    "          ```\n",
    "  2. Restart the Deepnote machine (or run the `Init` notebook)\n",
    "- **Alternatively:** Run `!pip install gcsopt` within a cell in the Deepnote notebook. You will have to do this everytime you restart your Deepnote machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (Advanced Users) Updating the `manipulation` version\n",
    "We continually add new features to the `manipulation` package, which is automatically updated in Deepnote. However, after you first click \"Duplicate\", you will stop receiving these updates. Follow these steps to update your version to the latest version:\n",
    "1. Find the latest version number for `manipulation` on the [PyPi package page](https://pypi.org/project/manipulation/#history).\n",
    "2. Update the version number for `manipulation=year.month.day` in the `requirements.txt` file on the left\n",
