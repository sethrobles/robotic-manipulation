In this notebook, we will combine these tools together to build an entire pick and place system based on the previous exercises that pick up your initials.\n",

    "# Part 1: Setting Up the Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Exercise 1.4](https://manipulation.csail.mit.edu/intro.html#section7) from chapter 1 you created a scenario file for custom objects and used the `MakeHardwareStation` function and `LoadScenario` functions to create a simulation with your initials.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll repeat that setup so we can get started with our simulation. Unlike in that notebook, however, this time we will also add a set of scene cameras so we can also sense object locations. We'll make use of the `LoadScenario` function which will abstract away setting up the systems for all the cameras and the driver logic. In this section, we'll add onto this and create a more complicated scenario using all of the different types of functionalities of a scenario:\n",
    "* Directives for all the robot arms, tables, and cameras\n",
    "* Model drivers for all the robot arms so they can actually be actuated\n",
    "* Cameras with corresponding configs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because our simulation now consists of a lot of moving parts including the directives for both the robot arms and cameras, we will modularize the components into two parts: the directives and drivers/cameras. Then, simply running `LoadScenario` to get a `Scenario` config object and then running `MakeHardwareStation` will generate all the necessary systems for all the cameras which will allow us to generate the necessary point cloud geometry. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we generate the initials and table assets again. For simplicity, in this notebook we will ask that you only generate one of your initials. In order to use the depth camera sensors to get the point clouds, we need to make sure our meshes also have all the normal information added (in real life all of this information is just available in the scene but in simulation these are properties that must be made available). Fortunately, this can be done by simply adding the`include_normal=True` argument to the original `create_sdf_assets_from_letter` function. Let's do that below:\n",
    "\n",
    "**YOUR TASK**: Regenerate the letters with normals, create a station with the robot, cameras, and depth sensors, and add the corresponding systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts**: Using directives to append scenarios and adding point clouds to the system with `AddPointClouds` and `DepthImageToPointClouds`."

    "Now that we have the scenario file, we'll load it up into a DiagramBuilder using `MakeHardwareStation`. In order to get the point clouds for the meshes we will need to add the neccesary systems to the diagram. As in [Exercise 4.9](https://manipulation.csail.mit.edu/pose.html#exercises), we make use of the `AddPointClouds`function in `manipulation.station` which under the hood adds a `DepthImageToPointCloud` system to each camera (and connects it to the corresponding ports) in order to extract the corresponding point clouds. We will then need to export the output ports for this system to the output of the diagram allowing for these point clouds to be accesed for when we do ICP later."

In this notebook, we'll take a slightly more realistic example: rather than using a single point cloud, we will make use of point clouds from multiple different cameras by merging them through concatenation (as a follow up, in a future exercise you will use RANSAC to remove outliers in the point cloud - in this notebook we simply merge them and call it a day). \n",
