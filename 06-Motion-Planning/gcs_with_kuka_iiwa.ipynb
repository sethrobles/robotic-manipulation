We highly recommend reviewing the figure under 6.4.1 to get a visual intuition for how you're building a graph through convex polytopes, and how GCS searches through. By the end of this section, your trajectory should start in the center outside of the top shelf and stop at the leftmost side inside the top shelf.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before beginning, please read through the [Drake documentation](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/classdrake_1_1planning_1_1trajectory__optimization_1_1_gcs_trajectory_optimization.html) on `GcsTrajectoryOptimization`. Specifically you'll need the `AddRegions` and `AddEdges` functions.\n",

This means that we'll be solving a GCS problem from the `start_region` to the top shelf, the `shelf_region`, and our trajectory may not make use of the `home_region`. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you're curious, you can solve the GCS problem from the initial Kuka Iiwa joint positions from which the `home_region` was expanded. To do this, set your `q_start` to the Kuka Iiwa's initial position. You can get this using `plant.GetPositions(plant_context)`, but **be mindful of the state of your `plant_context` when you make this call** as we've modified our context during the IRIS region construction phase. You may want to use the `q0` we saved earlier in the PSET before expanding the IRIS regions.\n",
