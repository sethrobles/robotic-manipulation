Forward kinematics is the mapping from joint angles to frames on the robot. For this problem, we will limit ourselves to computing the 2D position of the end-effector from the joint angles of our manipulator. In the [monogram notation](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__multibody__quantities.html) introduced in the textbook, this means writing down the 2D position of the red point in space with respect to the green frame, ${}^A p^C$, as a function of joint angles $(q_0,q_1)$. \n\n**Below, your job is to write down the forward kinematics of the manipulator.
