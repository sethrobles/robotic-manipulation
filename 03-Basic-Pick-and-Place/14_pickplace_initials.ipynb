You will have to specify the start and goal poses of the gripper such that the letters in your initials are grasped and placed appropriately.

Perform the necessary spatial algebra for designing grasp and placement poses\n2. Use Differential IK to write a gripper controller\n3. Understand the diagram structure for an actively controlled IIWA wrapped in a `HardwareStation`\n\n**What you'll build:** A simulation of the IIWA manipulating your initials such that they get placed in front of the robot. \n\n**Reference:** The structure is quite similar to the [Pick and Place Demo in Chapter 3](https://manipulation.csail.mit.edu/pick.html#example13) of Robotic Manipulation. <u> Take a moment to make sure that notebook makes sense to you.</u>\n\nLet's start by getting our imports out of the way and launching Meshcat.

The grasp pose in the world frame can be computed by \n\n$${{^WX^G} = {}{^W}X^{O}} {^OX^G},$$\n\n\nwhere $W$ stands for the world frame and $G$ denotes the grasp frame, following the convention in the textbook.\n\n\nYou should notice from the visualization below that the gripper frame is different from the world frame. In particular, the +y axis of the gripper frame points vertically downward, and the +z axis of the gripper points backward. This is an important observation for this exercise.\n\nSimply commanding the gripper to the grasp pose does not ensure a collision-free path.
